myfirs  - only text, easy, remembered a lot...

ex1     - I started at home but still struggled with the boxes
        - had less experience with this in the past, more deatil on css...
        - the discovery of the google inspect.. complex

ex2     - the boxing felt easier, but in hindsight I complicated a lot
        - tried to solve the problem of middle floating

ex3     - tried to use the previous and just tweak it
        - sometimes it is better to have a fresh start
        - at the end of the day I redid it in 5 min after the evaluation

ex7     - realized how much easier and nicer just to use different id, class...
        - finished in just a minute or two

CV      - at the beginning, no idea where to start, owerwhelming
        - than small steps, focusing on one problem at a time, got better
        - even now had to go back to the video and steal from presentation.
        - good teamwork
        - at the first it was CTRL c +v here the whole outer source.. just formatting
        - much more structured
